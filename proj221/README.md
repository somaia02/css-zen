I was trying to copy [this](https://www.csszengarden.com/221/). This was overwhelming at first glance. I wasn't sure if I could do it but I managed to finish half the design. I had planned to try to do it myself and look at the source when I get stuck. But they're doing it very differently. The source doesn't even use `grid`. I'm halfway through so I don't want to discard all my work. I might come back later to give this another try.
